# css parser

Use 
`@define VariableName Value`

in your Css file to define variables. You can reference other variables as values, however they must be defined in a sequential order.
See `easy.css` as any example.

To compile the css file you have to run a.out for macs, passing the source filename and the destination filename respecitvely.
